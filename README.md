# IncuScan  - An Open-Source 3D Laser Scanner

## What is IncuScan

The IncuScan project started in 2018 at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences in partnership with Erasmus MC. The goal is to create a 3D image of a baby inside an incubator to monitor the growth of the baby's length. After finding inspiration in the FabScan PI project. The idea was born to make a 3D laser Scanner with the Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi Camera Module and a laser diode. This version is written in python, C and MATLAB.
